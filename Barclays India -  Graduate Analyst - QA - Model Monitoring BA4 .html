                  About Quantitative Analytics

                  About QA Model Monitoring
                  <br/>
                  Model Monitoring acts as one of the primary ways to mitigate Model Risk by highlighting areas of sub-optimal
                  <br/>
                  performance and by proposing effective remediation plan for models in use by business. Model Risk is the potential
                  <br/>
                  for adverse consequences (e.g. financial loss, reputational impact, regulatory censure etc.) from decisions based on
                  <br/>
                  incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This can arise from fundamental model weaknesses leading to
                  <br/>
                  inaccurate outputs, errors in implementation, or incorrect/inappropriate use. Monitoring team periodically evaluate
                  <br/>
                  model performance. Monitoring findings help business to decide upon the further uses of the model in order to
                  <br/>
                  Continue, Adjust and then Continue or discontinue and Rebuild the Model.
